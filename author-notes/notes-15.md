Not really much to say about this one. It took a long time to get this chapter done considering the final length but I really had to start over from scratch a couple of times. Caster isn't the most explored character in Canon, so writing her in depth while staying true to what is known about her is quite the challenge.

If you want to discuss something about this chapter or the story in general go to my forum (see profile).

Anyway, thanks for reading and for reviewing.
