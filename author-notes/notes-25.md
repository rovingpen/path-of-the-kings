I can't believe it's been over three months since the last update. Sure a lot of stuff happened to me in the meantime and this chapter had gone more revisions than any other thus far. Then again the plot is getting complicated, more characters are making their appearances and their actions are having longer lasting repercussion. It's a difficult phase overall.

I can't make promise about update rates at this point. Every time I do it takes more than the previous time to complete a chapter. The only thing I can guarantee is that I'm going to try my best to deliver high quality chapters as soon as possible.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

Until the next time.
