AN: Put it up in a rush before leaving for work. Not really much to say about this one. I might add another author note depending on the reviews later, but that's it for now. Bring all eventual bitchings to the forum (not the spoiler one)

Thanks for reading.

AN2: Edit: I wrongly assumed that Rin had vampiric ancestry because Zelretch is considered her Ancestor. That was a mistake because Zelretch's disciple was her actual ancestor. I corrected that part. Kudos to blakraven66 for pointing it out.
