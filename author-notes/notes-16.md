Did it really take me a whole month to write this chapter? Yeah, it certainly did. Then again I also managed to update another of my fics and be sick in bed for a week, so I can say that I've been quite productive.

So, I already know that this chapter is going to raise more than a few eyebrows, especially because of Waver's intuition about Emiya and Shirou's knowledge of Medea's name.

Most of it will be explained in the next chapter but if you can't wait come ask question in my forums and you'll be answered.

That's it for now.

See ya!
