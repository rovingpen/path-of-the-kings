So here I go again with yet a new fic. Didn't I have too much on my plate already? Apparently no. So here's my Fate/Stay Night fic. Let me know what you think.

Note: This story is part of my "King's Universe" like my HP Fic "Rise of the Forgotten" and my KP fic "Identities". These fics won't intesect **at all** so don't worry about any odd character from those stories showing up.

PS: I know that the UBW chant is different but this Shirou is not the same as the one depicted canonically. If you want to find out more make sure to stick around.

Don't know when I'll update this. My other fics are my main priority as of now but when I'll get back to this one once I hit writer's block with those stories (which happens more often than not.)

That's all for the time being. Bye.
