Looking through the web for opinion on my story I found a considerable amount of people telling me that the major flaw of "Path of the King" is the slow development. I'm aware that I'm still too inexperienced to write short yet meaningful chapters but I also try to depict characters in depth. I don't like taking for granted that my readers have the same amount of knowledge as I do. Some people who read F/SN fics have only watched the anime and never played the Visual Novel, but even without that I'd rather write a story that can be read on its own with previous knowledge.

I'm sorry if you find this boring but that's the way I like to write.

No a better note, now that the basis of the story has been deployed and character interactions defined , the plot should advance a lot more faster. 4-5 chapters and this arc should end. There will be another couple of arcs (shorter than this) before we get to the HGW.

In any case, thank you for reading and eventually reviewing.

Till next time.
