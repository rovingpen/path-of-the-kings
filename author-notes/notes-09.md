And the plot thickens. A new enemy for Shirou appears and it won't make it any easy for him to proceed. Sorry if I added a Black Lagoon reference in this chapter, but I can't resist the temptation of shouting out to other series. To be entirely honest I had initially planned of having Shirou tracking Yukiko all the way there and start a mini crossover with that series, but it would have only made things a lot more complex. I already borrowed Dojima from Persona 4. That should be enough.

In any case read and review.
