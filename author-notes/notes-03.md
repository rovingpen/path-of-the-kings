Another chapter is here. I'm trying to keep a steady pace with all of my stories but I have to admit it's rather difficult. Now, this chapter gives us another insight on Shirou's life. For those who ask, yes Avalon has a minor regenerating power even of Arthuria isn't around. No big thing, just something that could be granted by lots of other stuff.

I've published a FSN x Love Hina story if you are interested. Check my profile if you want.

Well, I don't have much else to say, so goodbye for now.
