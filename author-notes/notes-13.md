All right. I wanted to write around 5 to 7K word per chapter but this one totally screwed my average. 20k for a single chapter is way over anything I planned to write short of a one shot, so don't expect another chapter this long in a while.

That aside, am I the only one that thinks Shirou would make for a terrific surgeon? With his ability to replicate all the techiques applied to every blade he has seen, Shirou should be capable of jumpstarting his learning process by simply tracing used scalpels. He would still require to learn the basics of anatomy, that's true but he could accelate the progress greatly.

Just a thought.

Anyway thanks for reading and for reviewing.

See ya.
