Well, I suppose I could have made this chapter longer and more eventful but it would have required more time to update and in order to set up the mood for a fight would have taken too long without a break of sort.

This is also the last time in a long while where Medea will be seen crying. Seriously, she's a Heroic Spirit not a crybaby. She might have had her moments but this is it. Now it's about time she goes back to her usual evil self we all have learned to love and hate.

Anyway here's another chapter and just in time for Christmas too. So, ho-ho-ho people, this is my gift for you. Enjoy it. Or not. Either way I'm expecting a shitload of comments as **my** Christmas gift so you'd better damn well **REVIEW**! And don't forget to praise RavingScholar for editing this chapter in no time as well.

Happy holidays!
