All right, another chapter is out. I suppose that at this point you should be able to understand what was Guilford unforgivable sin in Caster's eyes. You might be curious as of why the Grail is dishing out Command Seal so early before the war and not in the correct order.

if you want explanations, either wait for the story to eventually explain it (very far in the story) or ask for details in my Forum. No need to increase the word count with a long explanation.

That will be all for now.

See ya.
