Small cliffhanger and a little insight to most character's inner thoughts. Not much else to say.

Sorry about the delay. This chapter has been ready for almost three weeks but my beta was and is busy. Seeing that six weeks passed from my last update I decided to put it up as it was. I hope you enjoyed it.

Next chapter is almost complete but it still has to be edited so don't hold your breath. Hopefully it will be uploaded within the week.

Well that's it for now.

Thank you for all the reviews.

Bye.
