Man, this sure was a though chapter to write. Trying to stay true to Rin's and Saber's characters in a new set of circumstances was very difficult, especially for Rin. Like I said in the forum she's a triple layered character who isn't honest even with herself, making writing in her POV a daunting task.

Well, this is it for now.

As usual my thanks go to RavingScholar for a job well done and also to twinkieman92 for helping out several times.

If you enjoyed this chapter is also thanks to them.

That's it for now. See ya.
