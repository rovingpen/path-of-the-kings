Author's notes and a bit of in-universe mechanics (yeah, specifically in this order).

... Why is that many people asked me if put up the last chapter fast because of In Flight and From Fake Dreams? I don't really care for what people think so I'll say this just once.

I have a single criteria for updating my stories, which is putting the new chapter up as soon as it's done and edited (sometimes even before it's edited). This is not a damn competition so I don't try to "ride" the wave of other author's popularity and whatnot. I daresay I've done well enough without squeezing an extra review or two using some dumb update strategy.

With that out of the way let's address a few issues about the last chapter and the universe in general

**The summoning ritual:**

I got a lot of people telling me that since Schweinorg is Sakura's and Rin's ancestors they are the only one who can use that specific aria. I disagree. My interpretation of the term ancestor is a reference to the fact that Schweinorg is a Dead Apostle *Ancestor* and having taken part in making the Heaven's Feel Ritual of Fuyuki, using that particular Aria is like saying "this ritual is patented." Certainly another Aria can be used, but to me that's the most appropriate one unless the prospective Master bothered making a new one by himself and it's not something that requires a couple of minutes to be done. So he went for the "Summoning Ritual for Dummies."

**Mystic Codes and Noble Phantasms:**

Yes, I know that Noble Phantasms can exist in the real world as well but let's make a few things clear. Those NPs that can be still found in the world as Noble Phantasms were made as Noble Phantasms to begin with. Fragarach was made by the gods, Avalon was artifact from the Fae that is a Conceptual Weapon, a gate to the realm of the Fae and the crystallization of the wish of mankind for a world without pain. Something like that could only be a Noble Phantasm from the very beginning. Of course I'm aware that the passing of time and the gathered fame can eventually make a normal tool, a conceptual weapon or a Mystic Code into a Noble Phantasm but generally the very passing of time that grants them this enhancement destroy their physical form before they get a chance to reach that point.

**The summoning of Saber:**

For those who haven't watched or read Fate/Zero I'm going to inform you that it's the Grail itself that summons the Heroic Spirit in accordance with the offered Catalyst or Magus' character. What the Magus only does if providing an anchor and an additional energy source for the Servant to exist in this plane. On a minor note, most of the sustainment of a Servant it's done by the Grail itself and that why Saber couldn't remain in this world at the end of the Fate Route (and the anime). Of course Rin, being the Prana juggernaut that she is, has more than enough power to maintain a Servant like Saber in this world by herself (though it constantly takes over 80% of her reserves to do so).

**The age of the characters and general timeline**

Originally FSN took place in February of year 200X, sometime later the events of Tsukihime (if you are familiar with it, if not that's an unforgivable sin ). Shirou was 16 and in his second year of high school. The story is now about to reach the summer of "200X -1" so it's around 8 months earlier than Canon and Shirou is still 15 and in his first year. Consequentially Sakura is still in middle school and doesn't attend Shirou's school. This doesn't mean that it will take eight more months for the war to start. It will start earlier than Canon so don't breath on my neck about it. It's still a few months away, though. Deal with it.

That's all for now. I hope I made everything clear.

Many thanks to RavingScholar for yet another excellent job at editing this chapter.

See ya soon.
