There we go. The long awaited fighting scene.

Before anyone starts whining about the impossibility of Kanshou and Bakuya to be around let me just make something perfectly clear. These two swords, as stated in the chapter itself, are Mystic Codes, not Noble Phantasms.

I don't think it was ever properly explained in the Nasuverse but I think the a Noble Phantasm isn't actually the same weapon wielded by the Heroic Spirit, but rather is very same concept as taken from the Root and then elevated through the power of its legend.

Just like the body of a dead Hero doesn't ascend to the Throne, the original Mystic Code (If such was the origin of the NP) remains in the world and if properly taken care of it can be preserved to the modern era.

That being said I hope you all enjoyed this chapter.

See ya soon.
