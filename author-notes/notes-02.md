Yeah. This is it. I always considered funny that someone who wanted to be a Hero so badly did nothing at all to become one. So this time around Shirou is acting like the Hero he wants to become by doing some small vigilantism on his own. Too bad Tohsaka is on his case.

The war will arrive in a few months but before then Shirou will find himself in more than a few messy situations, a few of which won't be related to Magic. How will this make things for him? Keep reading to find out

Review answers:

Kiyomaro-kun: My first Italian reviewer. Thanks for your support.

Angry Santo: Duh! Harem! You have to wait to see who will be part of it.

Sperance: Thanks! I'll hope to meet your expectations.

Orchamus: Yes, Third Fang's stories are the best. I already had this fic in mind before he began his "From fake dreams" but I have to admit the sheer awesomeness of it prompted me to finally start writing this one.

Chad001: I beg to differ. In canon Shirou is never at Servant level. Sure he can take them on and win but it has an heavy toll on him when he does. To be Servant Level means to be capable of using said level of ability without the drawbacks.

rajvir: It should be somewhat long. There are going to be a few chapters before the war where Shirou goes on his quests as Archer. Then it will come the war in all of its glory and maybe after that I will write a few adventures for him (no promises)

Well that's all for this time folks.

Till next time.
