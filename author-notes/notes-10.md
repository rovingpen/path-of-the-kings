Some explanations and maybe some spoilers - read at your own risk:

I had mixed opinions about this part of the story. I'm probably going to have mixed responses as well. I know that Sasaki Kojirou was considered a fictional character in the Navuverse, however according to Type-Moon wiki his existence was merely *'dubious'* and not outright fake.

A person who left enough of an impression to generate a Wraith like False Assassin surely was more than just a legend. Therefore I thought it shouldn't be odd that such a character would inspire someone to restore is sword style and carry his name.

From there I came up with the idea of the Fake False Assassin.

That being said, this Sasaki Kojirou is nowhere in the league of Servant that goes by the same name. He believes to be nearly as the same level of the *real* Sasaki, but he's mistaken.

Anyway, his role is fulfilled for the time being. His presence served many purposes in Shirou development. Three, to be precise. I will not dwell much on the first two, but the third was obviously to deliver Shirou his Monohoshi-zao.

Frankly speaking, I can't think of another sword that Shirou could find before the HGW that could initiate him to his real talent. Monohoshi-zao is a normal, if not common, sword in itself, yet it carries a treasure that Shirou alone can fully access.

It's going to take him a while to understand the implication of having come to possess such a blade, but everything as to start from somewhere.

Well, that's it for the time being. Thanks for reading. Bye.
