Whoops. Bombshell? Is this Caster, *The Caster*, or is this somebody else taking a mantle like Shirou and accidentally robbing a Servant of her title? And what's wrong with Issei?

That shouldn't be difficult to understand. Talking about Issei, he's a severely underused character. It always struck me as odd that he was able to see behind Rin's mask just like that. In this story he will have a more important role and the reason behind his dislike for Rin explained further.

Now, to answer a few questions:

I included Ryutaro Dojima and Toru Adachi from Persona 4 because I needed a set of secondary characters and didn't want to lose days to think about them. There is no connection whatsoever with their original story beside their background and overall character.

Also, I've found a couple of beta editor although, just like promised, I decided to upload the newest chapter first and update later to reduce the time. So if you prefer to read the story once it has been properly edited I would advise to come back when you see the word 'Edited' right under the chapter title,

That's all for now.

Over and out.
