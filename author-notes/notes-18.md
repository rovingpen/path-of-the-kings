A\\N: Damn it! I had to break the chapter in two again. Seriously, the fight will be next chapter. I swear.

That being said, in this chapter I've fiddled with Nasuverse's universe a little. I don't think I've violated any rule of any sort but I've rather conveyed how I think the background mechanics works.

Let me know what you think,

See ya.

A\\N2: I've been pointed out that Misaki city actually has a stronger leyline than Fuyuki. I've corrected that part to match this info. Thanks to all who pointed it out.
