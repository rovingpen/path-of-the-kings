# Prologue -- Made out of Blades

*'Not today.'*

Reality might plow over dreams and through heroes, but today he would triumpth over reality itself. Today, he would be the hero that saved *everyone*.

He pushed through the blood and pain and stood straight once more. Avalon worked fast, but even Excalibur's Scabbard couldn't keep up with the onslaught of countless Noble Phantasms.

*'Trace On.'*

A smile crept over his face despite the pain.

There was but one path ahead, and those two words were all he needed to keep moving---the only weapons he needed against his one true opponent.

Not the blond haired King of Heroes in front of him.\
Not the immortal demigod that fought for the snow haired girl.\
Not the priest that had orchestrated this sick plot.\
Not the worm filled Head of an ancient family of Magi.\
Not the many phenomenon that had been evoked for that pointless war.\
No one else but himself.

Against the temptation to give up, to cast away his dreams, to live content with what little he could manage to save.

*'Never.'*

That single minded conviction, that na√Øve stubbornness, that resolve was the fulcrum of his flawed existence.

He grit his teeth, his muscles tightened and his Od flowed through his circuits. The pain had been cast away, the fear crushed, the doubts destroyed. As a human he couldn't hope to win against a Servant. But he wasn't just a man anymore.

*'I am the bone of my sword...'*

The Noble Phantasms within the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gate of Babylon</span> shot toward him as fast as bullets, but their assault was stopped by an equal number of his own.

*'Iron is my blood and Glass is my Heart...'*

Another salve of weapons flew toward him like oversized arrows.

Gilgamesh's arrogance was his ultimate weakness. Victory was to be achieved on his terms or not at all. He didn't even consider of drawing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ea</span>, the Sword of Rupture. In response <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rho Aias</span> sprung into existence, pulled from the Hill of Swords by a nudge of the boy's mind, hopelessly crushing the thrown blades.

*'I have withstood untold pains to create countless weapons...'*

Reality around him began to crack as the boy kept chanting, pushing his own Origin against the World. The King ignored it, as if it was beneath him to acknowledge someone so low as that Faker as an actual threat.

*'I have walked many battlefields undefeated...'*

As usual the change began from within. Wounds began closing with a metallic screech. Not healing, but kniting together with countless tiny blades.

*'Not once I have retreated. Nor once I have strayed...'*

His circuits were alight with power. Mana flowed in his body through his contracts. His body was a vessel for power, albeit not in the Servant's league. Not that it mattered. Thaumaturgy was about Will rather than raw strength and he had that in spades.

*'I have no regrets. This is the only path...'*

The world shaped on the boy's beliefs and convictions. Magecraft that bordered Sorcery. The closest thing to a miracle, that he could hope to accomplish with his own limited skills. The reason for his weaknesses and the source of his strength.

*'Certainly this body... is made out of blades...'*

*'My whole life is... Unlimited Blade Works!'*

Flames enveloped them, drawing the boundaries of his Reality Marble, cutting away the world that didn't accept his beliefs.\
Flames. Like those that had killed him so many years before.\
Flames. Like those he had been rescued from.\
Flames that shaped him into the Blade that he had chosen to be.

The Hill of Swords opened up before him. In his hands Kanshou and Byakuya, craving the coming fight.

"Here I come, King of Heroes. Do you have enough weapons at your disposal?"

He charged forward, ignoring the insults of the Archer Class Servant. Their blades met with a thundering clash of steel and in that single moment of blinding sparks his mind reeled back to the moment when he had begun to walk down this path.
